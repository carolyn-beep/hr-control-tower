-- SECURITY FIX: Replace overly permissive person table policies
-- This fixes the critical security vulnerability where employee personal information
-- was exposed to the public

-- First, drop the insecure public access policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view persons" ON public.person;

-- Create secure, role-based access policies for the person table
-- Policy 1: Allow admins and HR managers full access to all person data
CREATE POLICY "Admin and HR can view all persons"
ON public.person
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  has_role_access(ARRAY['admin'::app_role, 'hr_manager'::app_role])
);

-- Policy 2: Allow managers to view basic person info (names and departments only)
-- This is implemented as a view-level restriction - they get access but apps should filter columns
CREATE POLICY "Managers can view persons for team management"
ON public.person  
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  has_role_access(ARRAY['manager'::app_role])
);

-- Policy 3: Allow employees to view only basic directory information (names and departments)
-- Similar to managers, column filtering should happen at application level
CREATE POLICY "Employees can view basic directory info"
ON public.person
FOR SELECT  
TO authenticated
USING (
  has_role_access(ARRAY['employee'::app_role])
);

-- Ensure no INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE access for non-admin roles on person table
-- Only admins and HR managers can modify person data
CREATE POLICY "Only admin and HR can insert persons"
ON public.person
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  has_role_access(ARRAY['admin'::app_role, 'hr_manager'::app_role])
);

CREATE POLICY "Only admin and HR can update persons"
ON public.person
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  has_role_access(ARRAY['admin'::app_role, 'hr_manager'::app_role])
)
WITH CHECK (
  has_role_access(ARRAY['admin'::app_role, 'hr_manager'::app_role])
);

CREATE POLICY "Only admin and HR can delete persons"
ON public.person
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  has_role_access(ARRAY['admin'::app_role, 'hr_manager'::app_role])
);
